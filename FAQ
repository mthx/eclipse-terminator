1. View title isn't working or only works in some applications (e.g. vim).

You'll need to teach your bash start-up scripts about the 'terminator' terminal
type.  E.g. on Ubuntu edit ~/.bashrc and add '|terminator' (no quotes) to the
block below after 'rxvt*'.

 # If this is an xterm set the title to user@host:dir
 case "$TERM" in
 xterm*|rxvt*)
     PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}@${HOSTNAME}: ${PWD/$HOME/~}\007"'
     ;;
 *)
     ;;
 esac
