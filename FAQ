For general FAQs about the terminal emulation rather than the Eclipse
integration see

http://software.jessies.org/terminator/faq.html

1. View title isn't working or only works in some applications (e.g. vim).

You'll need to teach your bash start-up scripts about the 'terminator' terminal
type.  E.g. on Ubuntu edit ~/.bashrc and add '|terminator' (no quotes) to the
block below after 'rxvt*'.

 # If this is an xterm set the title to user@host:dir
 case "$TERM" in
 xterm*|rxvt*)
     PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}@${HOSTNAME}: ${PWD/$HOME/~}\007"'
     ;;
 *)
     ;;
 esac

See also jessies.org FAQ entry.

2. I can't see some text.

Some applications have a default color scheme that doesn't work well with a
black on white terminal.  This scheme was chosen as the default so as to fit
in with Eclipse.  For now there is no UI to change the color scheme so either
run Terminator itself and edit it there or change the colors used by the
application.

Specific applications:
  * irssi white-on-white: use one of http://irssi.org/themes e.g. foxmask.
  * vim see :colorscheme <tab> and :set background=light
