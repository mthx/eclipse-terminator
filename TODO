== To be usable for me
Initializing the termcap, or whatever I need to do to get Ctrl-D etc.
Exiting from shell should close the view.
Double spaced line weirdness.
Resizing - at the moment it only gets bigger!  Annoying if you maximize then restore.

== To be deployable
Work out where we should log to.
Figure out what to do with preferences.
Packaging of jars/native code.
Signal map.

== Fun future features
Multiple terminals
Command-as-editor (e.g. vim).
Eclipse based configuration?
