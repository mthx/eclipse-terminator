There's probably a whole load of things I've not thought of yet but here goes.

== To be deployable (Linux only)
- Ask whether using the Terminator name and icon is reasonable.

== Other
- Would be nice if Ctrl-W didn't close the active editor in Eclipse when
  the terminator view is focused.  This makes :split windows in vim
  pretty much unusable.
- If using as fast view (?) then restore doesn't redraw.
- GTK LAF seems to be unstable.
- Maximise loses focus from terminal.
- Fonts look ugly compared to gnome-terminal.
- "Monospace" font takes up too much vertical space when running with open-jdk.
- Partial text at the top - see Stuart Bell's suggestion in terminator TODO.
- Stacktrace in log on close.
- Eclipse based context menu.
- Eclipse based preferences.
- Open shell for current directory for Eclipse selection.
- Fail well on non-Linux and/or cross platform support (later).
- Command-as-editor (e.g. vim).  Hard to fit with the editor lifecycle though.
- Hyperlink support as in gnome-terminal.
- Foreground background color munging as in gnome-terminal, e.g. makes white
  on white viewable by darkening the foreground.
