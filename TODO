== To be deployable
Remove context menu.
Fix logging so it doesn't go to stdout.
Keyboard shortcut to focus the view.
Make black on white mode the default - blue is too bold for inside Eclipse.
Exiting from shell should close the view.
  - It does now, but with a logged stacktrace.
Signal map is OS specific?  Is the current one good for all Linux machines?

== Annoyances
Colors seem broken in black on white mode - irssi's highlighting of my nick is white on white!
Maximise loses focus from terminal.
Fonts look ugly compared to gnome-terminal.
"Monospace" font takes up too much vertical space.  Font looks fine in gnome-terminal. 

== Future
Fail well on non-Linux.
(later) Cross platform support
Eclipse based preferences
Multiple terminals
Command-as-editor (e.g. vim).
