There's probably a whole load of things I've not thought of yet but here goes.

== To be deployable (Linux only)
- Tidy up changes to terminator, remove/indirect references in JTerminalPane to
  bits of terminator we don't/shouldn't use (frames, shared app. instance).
- Keyboard shortcut to open or focus the view.
- Ctrl-PageUp/Down must not be eated by the terminal, they're needed to switch
  views in Eclipse.
- Vim changes view title but bash doesn't.  Are the escapes terminal (xterm?)
  specific?  What's the best place to try to fix this?  At least a FAQ entry
  with some bash that switches on TERM to set PS1 is required.

== Annoyances
- If using as fast view (?) then restore doesn't redraw.
- GTK LAF seems to be unstable.
- Colors seem broken in black on white mode - irssi's highlighting of my nick
  is white on white!  There's also screen(1) in the mix there though.
- Maximise loses focus from terminal.
- Fonts look ugly compared to gnome-terminal.
- "Monospace" font takes up too much vertical space when running with open-jdk.
- Partial text at the top - see Stuart Bell's suggestion in terminator TODO.
- Stacktrace in log on close.

== Future
- Eclipse based context menu.
- Eclipse based preferences
- Fail well on non-Linux and/or cross platform support (later).
- Command-as-editor (e.g. vim).  Hard to fit with the editor lifecycle though.
