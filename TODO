There's probably a whole load of things I've not thought of yet but here goes.

== Short-term todos
- [*] Automate the build, update site, the whole lot.  Record revision numbers and
  bundle source for everything.

== Blocking Linux release
- Starred short-term todos.
- Ask whether using the Terminator name and icon is reasonable.

== Blocking Mac OS/Windows release
- OSX Bundle-NativeCode testing.
- Ability to load Windows binary - dependency issue - cygwin?  Can't seem to load that directly.  What do jessies do?
- Error when no SHELL env. varible set (obv. only likely on Windows)
    java.lang.NullPointerException
      at java.lang.String.<init>(Unknown Source)
      at terminator.terminal.TerminalControl.<clinit>(TerminalControl.java:29)
      at terminator.view.JTerminalPane.newShellWithName(JTerminalPane.java:91)
      at net.hillsdon.eclipse.terminator.view.TerminatorView.createPartControl(TerminatorView.java:53)

== Other
- Eclipse based context menu 
    This seems unreasonably difficult: it doesn't show over Swing component
    on Linux and I can't seem to work around it.  Given up for now.  A different
    Shell works but is ugly.  We use the view drop-down instead.  Should do this
    only on Linux if it works on other platforms (but everything else is broken
    elsewhere right now).
- Fonts: the default 'logical' font 'Monospaced' isn't actually in the font
  dialog.  The actual(?) Linux font 'Monospace' (note no 'd') doesn't seem to
  display as fixed width.
- GTK LAF hits this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libxcb/+bug/87947
   - Enable for other platforms?  Enable when fix can be detected?
   - Only real impact is that scrollbars look out of place.
- If using as fast view (?) then restore doesn't redraw.
- Maximise loses focus from terminal.
- Partial text at the top - see Stuart Bell's suggestion in terminator TODO.
- Stacktrace in log on close.  This is not Eclipse specific.
- Command-as-editor (e.g. vim).  Hard to fit with the editor lifecycle though.
- Foreground background color munging as in gnome-terminal, e.g. makes white
  on white viewable by darkening the foreground.
- Consider limiting the scrollback.  konsole has all/none/limit.
- Occasional focus issue - example: Window->Preferences, Cancel - which doesn't affect
  other views.
- Occasional middle click select failure?
- Log, and expose log as bash script with env. var, so can do `tlog 1` to get at lines
  of output.  Or some other way, maybe using the clipboard.
- Flicker on open/close of find bar and switching between terminal views.
