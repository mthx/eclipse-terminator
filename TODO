== To be usable for me
Fix logging so it doesn't go to stdout.
Keyboard shortcut to focus the view.
Colors seem broken in black on white mode - irssi's highlighting of my nick is white on white!
Make black on white mode the default - blue is too bold for inside Eclipse.
Exiting from shell should close the view.
  - It does now, but with a logged stacktrace.

== To be deployable
Packaging of jars/native code.
Signal map.
Remove context menu.

== Annoyances
Maximise loses focus from terminal.
Fonts look ugly compared to gnome-terminal.
"Monospace" font takes up too much vertical space.  Font looks fine in gnome-terminal. 

== Fun future features
Multiple terminals
Command-as-editor (e.g. vim).
Eclipse based configuration?
