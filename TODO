There's probably a whole load of things I've not thought of yet but here goes.

== Short-term todos
- [*] Title on restore workbench is wrong.

== Blocking Linux release
- Starred short-term todos.
- Ask whether using the Terminator name and icon is reasonable.

== Blocking Mac OS/Windows release
- Binaries (are there cross-platform jessies.org nightlies we can copy from?).

== Other
- Make salma-hayek logging log to Eclipse error log.
- Activity monitor - italic table title as for JUnit?
- Fonts: the default 'logical' font 'Monospaced' isn't actually in the font
  dialog.  The actual(?) Linux font 'Monospace' (note no 'd') doesn't seem to
  display as fixed width.
- Add support for Find - consider Firefox style.
- GTK LAF hits this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libxcb/+bug/87947
   - Enable for other platforms?  Enable when fix can be detected?
   - Only real impact is that scrollbars look out of place.
- Would be nice if Ctrl-W didn't close the active editor in Eclipse when
  the terminator view is focused.  This makes :split windows in vim
  pretty much unusable. This can be fixed by changing the key binding to
  'Editing Text'.  Add to FAQ?
- If using as fast view (?) then restore doesn't redraw.
- Maximise loses focus from terminal.
- Partial text at the top - see Stuart Bell's suggestion in terminator TODO.
- Stacktrace in log on close.
- Eclipse based context menu 
    This seems unreasonably difficult: it doesn't show over Swing component
    on Linux and I can't seem to work around it.  A different Shell works but
    is ugly.  We use the view drop-down instead.  Should do this only on
    Linux if it works on other platforms.
- Command-as-editor (e.g. vim).  Hard to fit with the editor lifecycle though.
- Foreground background color munging as in gnome-terminal, e.g. makes white
  on white viewable by darkening the foreground.
- Consider limiting the scrollback.
- Occasional focus issue?
- Occasional middle click select failure?
