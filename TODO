There's probably a whole load of things I've not thought of yet but here goes.

== Short-term todos
- Hyperlink support as in gnome-terminal using Eclipse browser API.
    - Mailing list post suggests Ctrl-Click already does this.
- [*] Crash when running a second Eclipse
    - Due to blatting native libs?

== Blocking Linux release
- Starred short-term todos.
- Title on restore workbench is wrong.
- Ask whether using the Terminator name and icon is reasonable.

== Blocking Mac OS/Windows release
- Binaries (are there cross-platform jessies.org nightlies we can copy from?).
- Determine if we really need 1.6 (issue for Macs?)
- Cross-platform impl of getCwdOfTerminalIfPossible.

== Other
- GTK LAF hits this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libxcb/+bug/87947
   - Enable for other platforms?  Enable when fix can be detected?
   - Only real impact is that scrollbars look out of place.
- Would be nice if Ctrl-W didn't close the active editor in Eclipse when
  the terminator view is focused.  This makes :split windows in vim
  pretty much unusable.
- If using as fast view (?) then restore doesn't redraw.
- Maximise loses focus from terminal.
- Fonts look ugly compared to gnome-terminal.
- "Monospace" font takes up too much vertical space when running with open-jdk.
- Partial text at the top - see Stuart Bell's suggestion in terminator TODO.
- Stacktrace in log on close.
- Eclipse based context menu 
    This seems unreasonably difficult: it doesn't show over Swing component
    on Linux and I can't seem to work around it.  A different Shell works but
    is ugly.
- Eclipse based preferences.
    Not clear that storing them in Eclipse preference store is desirable but
    UI for editing them is.
- Command-as-editor (e.g. vim).  Hard to fit with the editor lifecycle though.
- Foreground background color munging as in gnome-terminal, e.g. makes white
  on white viewable by darkening the foreground.
- Consider limiting the scrollback.
