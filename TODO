There's probably a whole load of things I've not thought of yet

== To be deployable (Linux only)
Tidy up changes to terminator, remove/indirect references in JTerminalPane to
bits of terminator we don't use (frames, shared app. instance).
Fix logging so it doesn't go to stdout.
Keyboard shortcut to open or focus the view.
Exiting from shell should close the view.
  - It does now, but with a logged stacktrace.
Signal map is OS specific?  Is the current one good for all Linux machines?

== Annoyances
Setting the window (well, ViewPart) title doesn't seem to work in Eclipse.
GTK LAF seems to be unstable.
Colors seem broken in black on white mode - irssi's highlighting of my nick is white on white!
Maximise loses focus from terminal.
Fonts look ugly compared to gnome-terminal.
"Monospace" font takes up too much vertical space.  Font looks fine in gnome-terminal. 
Partial text at the top - see Stuart Bell's suggestion in terminator TODO.

== Future
Eclipse based context menu.
Eclipse based preferences
Fail well on non-Linux.
(later) Cross platform support
Multiple terminals - perhaps similar to the Console view which permits N in 1
and multiple views.
Command-as-editor (e.g. vim).
