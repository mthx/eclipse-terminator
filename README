This directory contains an incomplete, pre-alpha Eclipse plugin that embeds the
terminator terminal emulator in Eclipse.

To build you need sibling checkouts of the salma-hayek and terminator projects
with the patches in 'patches' applied.  Then run ./jars.sh to build them and
copy the relevant artifacts into the Eclipse plugin source tree.  For now the
plugin may only be built from within Eclipse.

The terminator and salma-hayek projects are available at

http://software.jessies.org

Apparently this has now moved to google code - shows how out of date this is...
